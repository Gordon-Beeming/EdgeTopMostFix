# Edge Top Most Fix

While Edge has an issue with it being the top most window you can run this little app to make it behave üòÅ

## Why does this exist?

You may have noticed if you are running the canary version of edge that recently edge was always on top of 
other windows. If this annoys you then you can compile this snipet of code that will run through all the end handles 
and sets the top most property to false

My Version: Version 77.0.211.0 (Official build) canary (64-bit)
